During Week 1, I completed several programming exercises on the Raspberry Pi Pico using Python and Wokwi. The tasks focused on learning basic GPIO control, input/output handling, and simple program logic.

Some of the exercises include:

Light control (Valopäälle) – Turning LEDs on and off

Traffic lights (Liikennevalot) – Simulating a traffic light sequence

Burglar alarm (Varashälytin) – Triggering an alarm with sensor input

Weather station (Sääasema) – Reading and displaying sensor data

Other exercises explored similar concepts with GPIO pins, sensors, and simple Python programming.

All programs were tested in Wokwi before using the Raspberry Pi Pico hardware.
